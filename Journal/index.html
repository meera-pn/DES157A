        The main takeaway that I had from the article was that the process of filling out a form is generally considered unpleasant, 
        and it is the designers job to keep it as easy and engaging as possible. This is generally done by making it easy to fill out 
        and easy to navigate, and providing clear feedback to user input.

        Many people will not finish completing a form if it is too long or difficult to fill out, and a designer wants to mitigate 
        that when designing one. This can be done by putting easier prompts (like their name) first in the form, and leaving the complex 
        ones for the end. If people are given easy prompts first, they are more likely to fill out difficult prompts later because they 
        feel committed to finishing. This can also be done by accurate labels and placeholder text, making optional and required fields clear, 
        providing a matching keyboard on mobile, adding a “show password” button, and other attributes that make a form easier to fill out.
