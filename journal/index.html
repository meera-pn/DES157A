        <h3>My Image</h3>

        <p>
            This image is interesting because it is my favorite photo from the Sarah Kinsley concert that I went to. I feel
            like it captures a lot of joy, and it feels freer and more fun than other pictures that are just her singing. 
            It also feels very intimate, and I'm towards the front of the crowd, and I feel like the artist will get a lot
            bigger soon so it feels like a bit of a time capsule - I don't think I'll be able to see her in such a small, packed
            venue again.
        </p>

        <p>
            The collection I am doing my project about is my CDs, and one of the CDs I have is of her album "Escaper", which was
            the album that she was touring in the photo.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think my collection displays something that I love, which is music. I grew up playing music in band and symphony and 
            chorus, and while I don't have time for that anymore, singing along to my favorite CDs in my car while I'm driving is
            one of my favorite pastimes.
        </p>

        <h3>Anya's Image</h3>
        <p>
            Anya's image seems to be an image of a bath and bodyworks candle. I am not entirely sure what it is about or referencing,
            as I do not really have more context other than a singular object. I assume candles are what she collects, and this candle
            is just one in her collection. However, without more information, I can only make guesses, which makes this image quite
            mysterious. I don't think it would be as mysterious seeing it as a part of a larger project, but as of now I find it difficult
            to glean anything from this image other than the fact that she owns a candle. I don't think anything about it stands out as 
            particularly interesting, but again, I think that will come with context.
        </p>

        <h2>Form Design - Response to <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">This Article</a></h2>
        <date>10/14/24</date>
    <p>
        The main takeaway that I had from the article was that the process of filling out a form is generally considered unpleasant, 
        and it is the designers job to keep it as easy and engaging as possible. This is generally done by making it easy to fill out 
        and easy to navigate, and providing clear feedback to user input. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Many people will not finish completing a form if it is too long or difficult to fill out, and a designer wants to mitigate 
        that when designing one. This can be done by putting easier prompts (like their name) first in the form, and leaving the complex 
        ones for the end. If people are given easy prompts first, they are more likely to fill out difficult prompts later because they 
        feel committed to finishing. This can also be done by accurate labels and placeholder text, making optional and required fields clear, 
        providing a matching keyboard on mobile, adding a “show password” button, and other attributes that make a form easier to fill out.
