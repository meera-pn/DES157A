                I thought the article was interesting because I remember looking at those pictures and doing the excercises back in
                middle and highschool. However, I thought that a lot of the images, looking at them now, are more simple to understand
                than they were when I was younger, so I guess I have developed those skills over time.

                When looking at the Awwwards website, one website that stood out to me was <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/airborne-studio">this one</a>.
                The moving parts and photo animations are very visually engaging, and the high contrast colors amplify this effect. Like this images
                in the NYT article, it gives the viewer a lot to look at and investigate.

            <h2>Overuse of Overlays - Response to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">This Article</a></h2>
            <date>11/19/24</date>
            <p>
                Overlays are very helpful, but they should only be used when appropriate. The article goes over the places to use (and not use)
                overlays. 
            </p>
             <p>
                 One example that the article uses is overlays on mobile devices. Generally, if an overlay is used on mobile, it will
                 fill the screen and may be unusable or un-exitable due to size. This is something that I have definitely experienced
                 in my own life, so it was interesting to see it laid out here. The article also talks about the actions that users will
                 be taking from the overlays. Filling out forms, displaying user requested information, or advertising a deal are all
                 valid ways to use overlays, but designers should make sure that they don't interrupt the overall flow of the UX and that
                 they are easy to dismiss.

        <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
        <date>11/14/24</date>
        <p>
            The main thing that I learned from this article was the idea of using design to direct the user to do things that 
            you want them to do. Something the article mentions a lot is putting options that the designers want users to choose 
            in easy to reach areas, and the non-desirable options in difficult to reach areas. This direction can also be done 
            through color, making a “rate” button bright green and eye-catching and an “ignore” button a more subdued blue, with 
            less emphasis placed on it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This relates to the idea of clearly showing the user which actions give certain results, like a pop-up animation to 
            show which button triggered the pop-up. This is important because sometimes, when I do something online, I trigger 
            something helpful and I don’t know how I did it, so I can’t access it again.
        </p>

        <p>
            One thing that stood out to me was the idea of emotional connection, though I think this would really only work with 
            character based games. When asking someone to rate the game, it says to have a character looking at them as part of 
            the overlay design. I think this is interesting because it really depends on the user feeling like they have some sort 
            of relationship with the character, where they want to help it out.

        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
        <date>10/29/24</date>

        <h3>My Image</h3>

        <p>
            This image is interesting because it is my favorite photo from the Sarah Kinsley concert that I went to. I feel
            like it captures a lot of joy, and it feels freer and more fun than other pictures that are just her singing. 
            It also feels very intimate, and I'm towards the front of the crowd, and I feel like the artist will get a lot
            bigger soon so it feels like a bit of a time capsule - I don't think I'll be able to see her in such a small, packed
            venue again.
        </p>

        <p>
            The collection I am doing my project about is my CDs, and one of the CDs I have is of her album "Escaper", which was
            the album that she was touring in the photo.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think my collection displays something that I love, which is music. I grew up playing music in band and symphony and 
            chorus, and while I don't have time for that anymore, singing along to my favorite CDs in my car while I'm driving is
            one of my favorite pastimes.
        </p>

        <h3>Anya's Image</h3>
        <p>
            Anya's image seems to be an image of a bath and bodyworks candle. I am not entirely sure what it is about or referencing,
            as I do not really have more context other than a singular object. I assume candles are what she collects, and this candle
            is just one in her collection. However, without more information, I can only make guesses, which makes this image quite
            mysterious. I don't think it would be as mysterious seeing it as a part of a larger project, but as of now I find it difficult
            to glean anything from this image other than the fact that she owns a candle. I don't think anything about it stands out as 
            particularly interesting, but again, I think that will come with context.
        </p>

        <h2>Form Design - Response to <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">This Article</a></h2>
        <date>10/14/24</date>
    <p>
        The main takeaway that I had from the article was that the process of filling out a form is generally considered unpleasant, 
        and it is the designers job to keep it as easy and engaging as possible. This is generally done by making it easy to fill out 
        and easy to navigate, and providing clear feedback to user input. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Many people will not finish completing a form if it is too long or difficult to fill out, and a designer wants to mitigate 
        that when designing one. This can be done by putting easier prompts (like their name) first in the form, and leaving the complex 
        ones for the end. If people are given easy prompts first, they are more likely to fill out difficult prompts later because they 
        feel committed to finishing. This can also be done by accurate labels and placeholder text, making optional and required fields clear, 
        providing a matching keyboard on mobile, adding a “show password” button, and other attributes that make a form easier to fill out.
